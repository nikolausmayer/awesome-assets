# awesome-assets
A collection of free (to the best of my knowledge) resources on the internet, mostly assets useful for 3D production.
Note that "free" does not mean "do whatever you want" -- restrictions may apply, such as "you need to credit the authors" (though I strive for CC0-licensed content where possible).
Unless noted otherwise, no usage restrictions like "non-commercial" or "research only" apply.
